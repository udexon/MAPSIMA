MAPSIMA: Make Programming Simple Again

Although many may disagree with one (former) presidential candidate who ultimately triumphed (pun?) from the "Make America Great Again" slogan, one has to admire the ingenuity in such a slogan -- invoking something people can recall and understand from the past -- and thus imitate it.

The abbreviation MAPSIMA also pays tributes to MACSYMA or MAXIMA, the legendary computer algebra system software written in LISP, although Lispers may disagree with the approach taken here, very much based on Forth.

So this repository is an entry point to guide readers, who may be experienced programmers or non-programmers, from 5 years old to 75 years old or beyond, to understand something no less than, and I boast not, the foundation of mathematics and programming. It will contain links to various articles already written in the other repositories (in this account) or elsewhere, providing overview, additional explanations and perspectives, to repackage them like a traditional book, that readers may take away, read slowly and understand.

So it begins ....

<hr>

In the beginning, programming was simple.

Of course it was.

But talking about programming languages that existed before the prime target readers of this article (20 to 30 year olds) may interest only a few history enthusiasts -- so we will deal with them separately.

So we will start with several hottest programming languages that 20 plus year olds might be interested in, nay, idolize, and demonstrate that there is one 50 plus years old programming called Forth, launched in 1968, that is superior to all the former, and even transcends the meaning of "beating its enemies", because it can "become part of its enemies", much like the legendary Mr Smith in the Matrix.

Then came MVC.

Now, it takes nothing short of wizardry to simplify them.

1) blade yield section
2) Routes are just paths.
3) From HTML to RPML

1)
To be able to simplify is magic.
Just use @section @yield to simplify blade to row blocks. 
Too much work to break up columns within rows. Leave this to next level break down.

2) need something more abstract to simplify MVC. It's now a workhorse. No glamour in knowing details.
Route is actually a misnomer for path, Euler's graph theory path!!
It is a universal notation to access functions and variables (objects) within the application, using URI convention. 
Route list basically contains all functions of an app. Work out views and controllers from here.

First Create variables as in conventional programming. Then create route, then create table, controller 

3) RPML

4) From path to RPN, Everything is graph
