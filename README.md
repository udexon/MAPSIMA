MAPSIMA: Make Programming Simple Again

Although many may disagree with one presidential candidate who benefitted from the "Make America Great Again" slogan, one has to admire the ingenuity in such a slogan -- invoking something people can recall and understand from the past.

The abbreviation MAPSIMA also pays tributes to MACSYMA or MAXIMA, the legendary computer algebra system software written in LISP, although Lispers may disagree with the approach taken here, very much based on Forth.
